Together we built World Wise, an interactive website for learning, and respecting various cultures and countries from around the world. Our mission is to break the barriers of borders, and bring people closer together by educating each other about our homelands, as every single one is individual and special in its own way. We hope that our users have fun while learning, and explore some places they have never before. Possibly even visit them some day!
